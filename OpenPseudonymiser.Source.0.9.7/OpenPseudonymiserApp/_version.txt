0.9.0
9 Sept 2011
 - Reset Version to sync with JHC request
 - App use the current directory (ie that for the input file) as the default for the output file (and continue with the option to change to another directory)
 - When it has finished changes the finish button to a close button
 - CryptoLib created and object made non static so we can just create one and call it's methods throughtout the processing. Negative the need to duplicate the code in the DLL and inside the WPF app for speed
 (although I've not done the speed tests yet)
 - Date processing improved and moved into the CyptoLib

 - Display validation of NHS count on the output screen allows cancel if the data looks duff early in the process
 - Built against CryptoLib 0.9.6 (this includes the change to always remove blanks from any field used in the digest)
 - Display missing rows on progress and show a hyperlink to the output folder
